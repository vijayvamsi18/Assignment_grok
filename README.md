# 📝 Conversation Management, Summarization, and JSON Schema Classification

## ✅ Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the process of managing conversations, generating summaries, and classifying data into a structured JSON schema using the **Groq API**. It is implemented in a **Google Colab notebook**, designed for easy execution, reproducibility, and efficient handling of conversational data.

## 🚀 Features

- **Conversation Management**  
  Organizes raw conversational data into structured format for further processing.

- **Summarization**  
  Automatically generates concise summaries of conversations, enabling fast understanding of the key points.

- **JSON Schema Classification**  
  Classifies extracted information and converts it into a structured JSON schema format based on predefined templates.

## 🎯 Objective

To process unstructured conversation data, summarize the content, and map important information into a JSON schema using Groq API. The solution helps streamline data processing workflows and supports integration in real-world applications like chatbots, automated reporting, and data ingestion systems.

## ⚡ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Google Colab  
- Groq API  
- Pandas  
- JSON  

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook.
2. Set up API credentials for Groq API.
3. Upload your conversation dataset in the required format.
4. Run all notebook cells sequentially.
5. The output will be generated as structured JSON files containing summaries and classification results.
